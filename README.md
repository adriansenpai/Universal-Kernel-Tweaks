UKT is an advanced governor and <code>kernel</code> tweaks collection that aims to greatly enhance power efficiency.
Universal Kernel Tweaks is a heavily modified version of Legendary Kernel Tweaks developed by Omar. All the credits go to the original developer, not only for his hard work on Legendary Kernel Tweaks, but also for being open to open-source community.

-   UKT aims to achieve a fair power consumption
Instead of tuning the parameters manually, UKT adopts Project WIPE open-source <code>interactive</code> parameters for the mainstream SOCs that are generated by machine learning <code>AI</code> via simulation and heuristic optimization algorithms.

-   [WIPE v2](https://github.com/yc9559/wipe-v2) focuses on meeting performance requirements when interacting with apps by reducing non-interactive lag, pushing the trade-off between fluency and power saving even further. <code>QTI Boost Framework </code>, which must be disabled before applying optimization, is able to dynamically override parameters based on perf hint. This project utilizes <code>QTI Boost Framework</code> and extends the ability of override custom parameters. When launching APPs or scrolling the screen, apply aggressive parameters to improve responsiveness at an acceptable power usage. When there is no interaction, use conservative parameters, use small core clusters as much as possible, and run at a higher energy efficiency under heavy load.
